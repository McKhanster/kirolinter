## 📝 Script Timeline

### **[0:00 - 0:30] The Agentic Revolution**

**[Screen: Terminal showing KiroLinter status dashboard]**

> "Welcome to the future of code review! I'm demonstrating KiroLinter - the world's first **autonomous AI agentic system** for code quality management. This isn't just another linter - it's a self-managing, continuously learning AI workforce."

**[Show agent status]**
```bash
kirolinter agent status
```

> "Six specialized AI agents working 24/7: Coordinator orchestrates workflows, Reviewer analyzes code with team patterns, Fixer applies safe changes, Integrator manages PRs, Learner adapts to your style, and Cross-Repo agent shares knowledge while preserving privacy."

**[Highlight the problem]**
> "Traditional tools require constant manual intervention. KiroLinter operates **completely autonomously** - learning your team's style, applying fixes safely, and improving continuously."

kirolinter agent learn --repo=. --commits=100 --verbose
```

**[While learning runs, narrate]**
> "The Learner Agent is analyzing 100 commits from our team, extracting coding patterns like naming conventions, complexity preferences, and documentation styles. This knowledge becomes the foundation for personalized code review."

**[Show learning results]**
```bash
📊 Analyzed 100 commits across 8 contributors
🎯 Extracted 67 coding patterns
✅ Stored 67 patterns (100% anonymized)

Key discoveries:
- Variable naming: snake_case preferred (91%)
- Function complexity: avg 6.8 lines, max 20 lines  
- Import style: stdlib first, alphabetical
- Documentation: 84% functions have docstrings
```
