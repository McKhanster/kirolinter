# KiroLinter DevOps Quality Gate Action

GitHub Action for running KiroLinter DevOps quality gates with comprehensive CI/CD integration.

## üöÄ Features

- **Pre-commit, Pre-merge, Pre-deploy, and Post-deploy** quality gates
- **AI-powered risk assessment** for deployment impact analysis  
- **SARIF report generation** for GitHub Security tab integration
- **Automatic PR comments** with quality insights
- **GitHub check runs** with detailed status reporting
- **Redis-powered** pattern matching and event storage

## üìã Prerequisites

This action requires:

1. **Redis server** running and accessible
2. **KiroLinter** installed with DevOps dependencies
3. **Proper GitHub permissions** (see below)
4. **Optional**: OpenAI API key for AI-powered features

## üîê Required Permissions

**CRITICAL**: This action requires specific GitHub permissions to function properly. Add this to your workflow file:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  checks: write        # Required for creating check runs
  pull-requests: write # Required for PR comments  
  security-events: write # Required for SARIF uploads
  issues: read
```

**Without these permissions, you'll get the error:**
```
Error: Resource not accessible by integration - create-a-check-run
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Resource not accessible by integration" Error

This error occurs when the workflow doesn't have the required permissions. Add these permissions to your workflow:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  checks: write        # ‚Üê This is required for check runs
  pull-requests: write # ‚Üê This is required for PR comments
  security-events: write # ‚Üê This is required for SARIF uploads
```

### Redis Connection Issues

Ensure Redis is properly installed and running:

```yaml
- name: Install and Start Redis
  run: |
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y redis-server
    sudo systemctl start redis-server
    redis-cli ping  # Should return PONG
```

### KiroLinter Installation Issues

Install with all required dependencies:

```yaml
- name: Install KiroLinter
  run: |
    pip install -e ".[devops,ai]"  # Install all features
    kirolinter devops init         # Initialize DevOps infrastructure
```

### Timeout Issues

Increase the timeout for large repositories:

```yaml
- name: Run Quality Gate
  uses: ./.github/actions/kirolinter-devops
  with:
    timeout: 600  # 10 minutes
```

## üîß Development

To rebuild the action after making changes:

```bash
cd .github/actions/kirolinter-devops
npm install
npm run build
```

The `dist/index.js` file must be committed after rebuilding.
