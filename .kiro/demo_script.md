# 🎬 KiroLinter Demo Script (3 Minutes)

**Demonstrating Spec-Driven Development with Kiro IDE**

---

## 🎯 Demo Overview

This 3-minute demo showcases KiroLinter's development journey using Kiro IDE's spec-driven workflow, from initial concept to production-ready tool with agent hooks and comprehensive analysis capabilities.

## 📝 Script Timeline

### **[0:00 - 0:30] Opening & Problem Statement**

**[Screen: Kiro IDE with empty workspace]**

> "Hi! I'm going to show you how I built KiroLinter, an AI-driven code analysis tool, using Kiro IDE's spec-driven development workflow. Instead of jumping straight into coding, Kiro helped me systematically transform a rough idea into a production-ready tool."

**[Show problem]**
> "The challenge: Python teams need intelligent code review that goes beyond basic linting - detecting security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and providing AI-powered fix suggestions."

---

### **[0:30 - 1:00] Spec-Driven Development Process**

**[Screen: Navigate to .kiro/specs/kirolinter/]**

> "Kiro's spec-driven approach breaks development into three phases:"

**[Show requirements.md]**
> "First, Requirements - I defined user stories and acceptance criteria in EARS format. Notice how each requirement is traceable and testable."

**[Highlight key requirement]**
> "For example: 'WHEN a user analyzes a Python file THEN the system SHALL detect security vulnerabilities and provide CVE-enhanced context within 5 minutes.'"

**[Show design.md]**
> "Next, Design - Kiro helped me create a comprehensive architecture with components, data models, and integration points."

**[Show tasks.md]**
> "Finally, Tasks - The design became 13 granular implementation tasks, each referencing specific requirements."

---

### **[1:00 - 1:30] Agent Hooks in Action**

**[Screen: .kiro/hooks/ directory]**

> "One of Kiro's most powerful features is agent hooks - automated workflows that trigger on events."

**[Show on_commit_analysis.md]**
> "I created a post-commit hook that automatically analyzes changed Python files after each git commit."

**[Demo the hook]**
```bash
# Make a test change
echo "unused_var = 'test'" >> test_file.py
git add test_file.py
git commit -m "Test commit hook"
```

> "Watch - the hook automatically runs KiroLinter and shows analysis results immediately. No manual intervention needed!"

**[Show pr_review_automation.md]**
> "I also built a PR review automation hook that posts detailed analysis comments directly to GitHub pull requests."

---

### **[1:30 - 2:15] Live Analysis Demo**

**[Screen: Terminal in KiroLinter directory]**

> "Let's see KiroLinter analyze its own codebase - this demonstrates real-world performance."

```bash
python tests/test_kirolinter_self.py
```

**[While running, explain]**
> "This self-analysis tests all major features: CVE database integration, HTML report generation, and performance validation."

**[Show results]**
> "Results: 35 files analyzed in under 3 seconds, 163 issues found including 4 critical security issues. The CVE database enhanced security findings with real vulnerability data."

**[Open HTML report]**
> "The interactive HTML report includes filtering, export options, and clickable diffs - all generated automatically."

---

### **[2:15 - 2:45] Key Achievements**

**[Screen: Show Week 4 milestone document]**

> "What makes this impressive is the development speed and quality achieved through Kiro's workflow:"

**[Highlight metrics]**
- ✅ **13 major tasks completed** in structured phases
- ✅ **CVE database integration** with NIST NVD API
- ✅ **Interactive HTML reports** with export functionality
- ✅ **95%+ test coverage** with comprehensive validation
- ✅ **Sub-3-second analysis** on medium-sized projects

**[Show self-analysis results]**
> "KiroLinter successfully found legitimate issues in its own code - unused imports, complex functions, and security patterns in test fixtures. This proves it's working correctly!"

---

### **[2:45 - 3:00] Closing & Impact**

**[Screen: README.md or final demo]**

> "Kiro IDE's spec-driven development transformed how I build software. Instead of ad-hoc coding, I had:"

- 📋 **Clear requirements** that guided every decision
- 🏗️ **Systematic design** that prevented architectural debt  
- ✅ **Traceable tasks** that ensured nothing was missed
- 🤖 **Automated workflows** that eliminated manual processes

> "The result? A production-ready code analysis tool that teams can actually use, built in a fraction of the time traditional development would take."

**[Final screen: KiroLinter analyzing a real project]**

> "KiroLinter is now analyzing real Python projects, finding security vulnerabilities, and helping teams write better code. All thanks to Kiro IDE's intelligent development workflow."
