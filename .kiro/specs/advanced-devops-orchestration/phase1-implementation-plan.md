- Integration tests with Redis broker

## Task 1.4: Enhanced Data Models and Database Schema

### Objective
Implement PostgreSQL schema for workflow state and analytics, create Pydantic models for API validation, and add data migration and retention systems.

### Implementation Details

#### 1.4.1 PostgreSQL Schema Design
```sql
-- Workflow execution tracking
CREATE TABLE workflow_executions (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    started_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    metadata JSONB
);

-- Analytics data storage
CREATE TABLE workflow_metrics (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    workflow_execution_id UUID REFERENCES workflow_executions(id),
    metric_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    metric_value NUMERIC,
    recorded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

#### 1.4.2 Pydantic Models for API Validation
- Request/response models for all API endpoints
- Data validation and serialization
- Type safety and documentation

#### 1.4.3 Data Migration System
- Alembic-based database migrations
- Version control for schema changes
- Rollback capabilities

#### 1.4.4 Data Retention Policies

- Configurable retention periods
- Archive strategies for historical data

### Files to Create/Modify
- `kirolinter/devops/database/` (new directory)
- `kirolinter/devops/database/models.py` (new)
- `kirolinter/devops/database/migrations/` (new directory)
