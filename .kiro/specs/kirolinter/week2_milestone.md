## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Focus

### 1. CI/CD Workflow Implementation

**File**: `.kiro/workflows/code-review.yml`
**Key Features**:
- Automatic PR analysis on push/PR events
- Changed file detection and filtering
- Reviewdog integration for line comments
- GitHub API summary comments
- Status checks for merge protection

**Testing Strategy**:
```bash
# Test workflow locally with act
act pull_request -e .github/workflows/test_event.json

# Test on sample repository
git clone https://github.com/pallets/flask.git
# Create test PR with intentional issues
# Verify workflow execution and comment posting
```

### 2. Enhanced Scanner Implementation

**Focus Areas**:
- **AST Visitor Optimization**: Improve traversal efficiency
- **Rule Accuracy**: Reduce false positives
- **Context Awareness**: Better understanding of code intent

**Inline AI Coding Prompts**:
1. "Generate AST visitor for detecting resource leak patterns in Python context managers"
2. "Create detection logic for inefficient pandas operations and suggest vectorized alternatives"
3. "Generate visitor to detect potential race conditions in threading code"

### 3. Suggester Enhancement

**Template Expansion**:
- Security fixes for common vulnerabilities
- Performance optimizations for data processing
- Code style improvements for readability

**AI Integration Testing**:
```python
# Test OpenAI integration with fallback
config = {
    'openai_api_key': 'test-key',
    'use_ai_suggestions': True,
    'fallback_to_rules': True
}
engine = SuggestionEngine(config)
suggestions = engine.generate_suggestions(test_issues)
```
