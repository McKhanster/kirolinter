KiroLinter Phase 8 Implementation Prompt

Objective: Implement Phase 8: Documentation and Deployment, completing tasks 23.1â€“23.3 to update README.md with agentic system overviews, create detailed user guides and tutorials, and revise the demo script for the hackathon presentation. Ensure all documentation aligns with requirements (All agentic, 9.5, 10.1) and prepares KiroLinter for the Code with Kiro Hackathon (deadline: Sep 15, 2025, 3:00 PM EDT).

Context:





Project: KiroLinter, an AI-driven Python code review tool for the Code with Kiro Hackathon (category: Productivity & Workflow Tools).



Phase 7 Status (from log.md):





73/73 Phase 7 tests passing (100% success rate), validating unit, integration, performance, and safety aspects.



Total tests: 145/145 passing (100% success rate across Phases 1â€“7).



Features validated: Safe fix application, rollback, audit trails, privacy protection, scalability for 10,000+ files, and concurrency.



Performance: <3s for 35 files, <10s for 10,000 files, <500MB memory usage.



Codebase: Includes agent.py, reviewer.py, fixer.py, integrator.py, learner.py, cross_repo_learner.py, workflow_coordinator.py, pattern_memory.py, config.py, issue.py, suggestion.py, daemon.py.



Redis Integration: Used for pattern storage, analytics, and audit trails with sub-millisecond operations.



Goal: Create comprehensive documentation to showcase the agentic system's autonomous operation, setup, usage, and Kiro IDE integration, with a 3-minute demo script ready for submission.



Technologies: Python 3.8+, LangChain, GitPython, Redis, APScheduler, psutil, Click, PyYAML, scikit-learn, numpy.



Phase 8 Tasks:





23.1: Update README.md with agentic system overview.



23.2: Create detailed user guides and tutorials.



23.3: Update demo script for hackathon presentation.
