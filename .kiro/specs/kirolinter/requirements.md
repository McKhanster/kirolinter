# Requirements Document

## Introduction

KiroLinter is an AI-driven code review tool designed to analyze Python codebases for code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks. The tool provides automated code analysis with personalized suggestions based on team coding styles, and integrates with GitHub for seamless pull request reviews. This tool aims to enhance code quality while reducing manual review overhead for development teams.

3. WHEN setting up exclusions THEN the system SHALL allow ignoring specific files, directories, or code patterns
4. WHEN configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration and report any errors
5. IF no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for Python projects
6. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply them to subsequent analyses without requiring restart

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a development team, I want an AI agent system that can autonomously handle code review, fix application, GitHub integration, and continuous learning, so that code quality management becomes fully automated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN agent mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL provide a multi-agent architecture with Coordinator, Reviewer, Fixer, Integrator, and Learner agents
2. WHEN the Reviewer Agent is invoked THEN it SHALL autonomously analyze code using existing scanner and engine tools with AI-powered prioritization
3. WHEN the Fixer Agent is activated THEN it SHALL generate and apply fixes using AI reasoning with safety checks and backup creation
4. WHEN the Integrator Agent is used THEN it SHALL automatically create PRs, post comments, and manage GitHub workflows
5. WHEN the Learner Agent operates THEN it SHALL continuously learn from feedback, commit history, and team patterns to refine analysis rules
6. WHEN agents collaborate THEN the system SHALL coordinate multi-agent workflows with proper task delegation and progress tracking
7. WHEN using conversation memory THEN agents SHALL maintain context across interactions for improved decision making
8. IF agent operations fail THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to standard KiroLinter functionality

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a development team, I want a fully autonomous AI agent system that proactively monitors, learns, and improves code quality without manual intervention, so that code quality management becomes a self-improving background process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Learner Agent analyzes commit history THEN it SHALL extract coding patterns, naming conventions, and team preferences with 80%+ accuracy
2. WHEN team patterns are identified THEN the system SHALL store them in persistent memory with confidence scores and frequency tracking
3. WHEN analyzing new code THEN the system SHALL prioritize suggestions based on learned team patterns and historical issue frequencies
4. WHEN fixes are applied THEN the system SHALL track success rates and user feedback to improve future suggestions
5. WHEN pattern confidence drops below 60% THEN the system SHALL re-analyze recent commits to update team preferences
6. IF no commit history exists THEN the system SHALL use general Python best practices and gradually learn from user interactions
7. WHEN new patterns conflict with existing ones THEN the system SHALL resolve conflicts using recency and frequency weighting

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI agent system to autonomously trigger analysis on code changes and apply safe fixes without manual intervention, so that code quality is maintained continuously.
