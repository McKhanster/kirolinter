# Requirements Document

## Introduction

KiroLinter is an AI-driven code review tool designed to analyze Python codebases for code quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks. The tool provides automated code analysis with personalized suggestions based on team coding styles, and integrates with GitHub for seamless pull request reviews. This tool aims to enhance code quality while reducing manual review overhead for development teams.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze a Git repository or local codebase for code quality issues through a CLI interface, so that I can identify and fix problems before they reach production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a Git repository URL THEN the system SHALL clone the repository and analyze all Python files
2. WHEN a user provides a local codebase path THEN the system SHALL analyze all Python files in the specified directory
3. WHEN analyzing Python code THEN the system SHALL detect code smells including unused variables, dead code, and complex functions
4. WHEN analyzing Python code THEN the system SHALL identify security vulnerabilities including SQL injection risks, hardcoded secrets, and unsafe imports using CVE database integration
5. WHEN analyzing Python code THEN the system SHALL detect performance bottlenecks including inefficient loops, redundant operations, and memory leaks
6. WHEN processing repositories with over 10,000 lines of code THEN the system SHALL complete analysis in under 5 minutes
7. WHEN the tool is invoked THEN the system SHALL provide a CLI interface built with Python's Click library
8. IF the analysis encounters non-Python files THEN the system SHALL skip them and continue processing

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive a structured JSON report of code issues with suggested fixes, so that I can understand and address problems systematically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON report containing all identified issues
2. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL include issue type, severity level, file location, line number, and description for each issue
3. WHEN generating the report THEN the system SHALL provide specific fix suggestions for each identified issue
4. WHEN requested by the user THEN the system SHALL generate diff patches showing exact code changes needed
5. WHEN generating patches THEN the system SHALL ensure the patches are valid and applicable to the original code
6. IF no issues are found THEN the system SHALL return a report indicating clean code status

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want the tool to integrate with GitHub pull requests, so that code review suggestions appear automatically as PR comments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configured with GitHub credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate with GitHub API
2. WHEN analyzing a pull request THEN the system SHALL post review comments on specific lines where issues are detected
3. WHEN posting comments THEN the system SHALL include the issue description and suggested fix
4. WHEN multiple issues exist on the same line THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single comment
5. IF GitHub API rate limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully and retry with backoff
6. WHEN PR analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL post a summary comment with overall code quality metrics

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want the tool to learn from our team's coding style and past commits, so that I receive personalized suggestions that match our established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing past commits THEN the system SHALL extract coding patterns and style preferences
2. WHEN learning from team style THEN the system SHALL identify common variable naming conventions, function structures, and code organization patterns
3. WHEN providing suggestions THEN the system SHALL prioritize fixes that align with the team's established coding style
4. WHEN detecting security vulnerabilities THEN the system SHALL integrate with public CVE database to enhance detection accuracy
5. WHEN team style conflicts with general best practices THEN the system SHALL flag this and suggest team-specific alternatives
6. IF insufficient commit history exists THEN the system SHALL fall back to general Python best practices
7. WHEN team style is updated THEN the system SHALL retrain and adjust future suggestions accordingly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure the tool's analysis rules and severity levels, so that I can customize it to match my project's specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the tool THEN the system SHALL allow enabling/disabling specific rule categories
2. WHEN configuring severity levels THEN the system SHALL allow customizing what constitutes low, medium, and high severity issues
3. WHEN setting up exclusions THEN the system SHALL allow ignoring specific files, directories, or code patterns
4. WHEN configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL validate the configuration and report any errors
5. IF no configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL use sensible defaults for Python projects
6. WHEN configuration changes THEN the system SHALL apply them to subsequent analyses without requiring restart
