Perfect! Let me analyze the current codebase and create a comprehensive plan for transforming KiroLinter into a fully agentic system. I'll document this plan and append it to the spec files.

🎯 Agentic System Analysis & Plan
Let me first read the current spec files to understand the existing structure:

🎯 Agentic Enhancement Plan Summary
I've successfully created a comprehensive plan for transforming KiroLinter into a fully agentic, autonomous AI-driven code review system. Here's what I've documented:

📋 Requirements Enhancement (Appended to requirements.md)
4 New Requirements covering autonomous operation, proactive learning, intelligent insights, and contextual memory
28 Detailed Acceptance Criteria ensuring measurable success metrics
Focus on 80%+ pattern accuracy, continuous learning, and autonomous operation
🏗️ Architecture Enhancement (Appended to design.md)
Enhanced Multi-Agent Architecture with autonomous capabilities
4 Upgraded Agents: Autonomous Reviewer, Proactive Fixer, Intelligent Integrator, Adaptive Learner
Advanced Memory System: Pattern Memory (SQLite), Knowledge Base, Enhanced Conversation Memory
Proactive Automation: Background daemon, Git hooks, intelligent scheduling
Learning Algorithms: Pattern recognition, rule optimization, team style evolution tracking
📝 Implementation Plan (Appended to tasks.md)
9 Phases with 24 Major Tasks and 40+ Subtasks
5-Week Timeline leading to hackathon submission (Sep 15, 2025)
Clear Success Metrics: 80% learning accuracy, 95% fix success rate, <3s analysis time
Risk Mitigation strategies for technical, timeline, and adoption challenges
🚀 Key Agentic Features Planned
