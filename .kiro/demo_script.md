**[Show agent status]**
```bash
kirolinter agent status
```

> "Six specialized AI agents working 24/7: Coordinator orchestrates workflows, Reviewer analyzes code with team patterns, Fixer applies safe changes, Integrator manages PRs, Learner adapts to your style, and Cross-Repo agent shares knowledge while preserving privacy."

**[Highlight the problem]**
> "Traditional tools require constant manual intervention. KiroLinter operates **completely autonomously** - learning your team's style, applying fixes safely, and improving continuously."
